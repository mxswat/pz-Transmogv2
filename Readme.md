# Read Me - How to Use
Since this mod generates the items at run time, the first time you enable the mod, you need to close and re-open the game.
This applies to servers too. Start the server with the mod, let it generate the items, and then restart it.
Once you have restarted, you can start enjoying the mod.


Use the right-click menu to generate the transmog item there are 2 kinds of transmog items.

- Cosmetic, these items look like clothing, but they have no stats or weight
- Hide, this item is invisible, and it allows you to hide the item in that specific clothing slot

You can also use the right click to change the item's colour and texture.
