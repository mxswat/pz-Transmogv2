description=[h1]Simple - For Single player and small servers for friends[/h1]
description=This mod generates the Transmog item at run time, you need to disable and re-enable the mod [b]the first time[/b] you enable the mod. (If Disable/Enable does not work, restart the game)

description=[h1]Q&As[/h1]
description=Q: Does this work with clothing mod [Insert mod name here]?

description=
description=Q: Does this work in MP?
description=A: Yes, that's why I remade this mod

description=Q: Can this mod be added to an existing save or server?
description=A: Yes
description=

description=
description=Q: Can I add this to my mod pack?
description=A: [b]No[/b], I spent too many weeks debugging and coding to get my mod used without credits.
